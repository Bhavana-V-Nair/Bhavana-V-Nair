Hi, I'm Bhavana 👋

🚀 About Me

I’m a 4th year Electronics & Communication Engineering student, passionate about pushing boundaries in VLSI, digital systems, and processor architectures.
My journey spans cutting-edge RISC-V processor design, hands-on Verilog wizardry, and real-world embedded solutions—each step driven by a hunger to build faster, smarter, and more reliable tech.
I thrive when cracking tough problems, bridging hardware and software, and fueling the kind of teamwork that sparks innovation.

🌟 Highlights & Impact

🔹 RISC-V Processor : Designed and verified Single cycle RISC V Processor  modules in Verilog including Instruction memory, Data Memory, PC, Regfile etc.

🔹 Smart Agriculture: Engineered a robust IoT system using ESP32: seamlessly integrated sensors and motor controls for automated, intelligent irrigation.

🔹 Tech Stack Mastery: Proficient in Verilog, C, Python and digital logic design—backed by hands-on expertise with Vivado and Cadence.

🔹 Women in Tech Lead: Leading at Tinkerhub TocH, I mentor, run technical workshops, and build inclusive communities driving tech adoption and learning.

🔹 Event Architect: From running electrifying orientation sessions to pioneering panel discussions and technical meetups, I energize teams and shape events that matter.
